# BreastCancerAnalysis

This project involves the analysis of survival times and associated factors for breast cancer patients using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The analysis is based on data from a 2017 study by Awodutire, Kolawole, and Ilori, published on the Mendeley Data platform.

Results and Recommendations
In this study, data from 89 breast cancer patients were used, obtained from the work of Awodutire, Kolawole, and Ilori, published in 2017 on the open-source platform Mendeley Data. The patients' survival times were right-censored one year after diagnosis. The recorded survival time spans from the day of diagnosis to the last contact (death, alive, or loss to follow-up) and is measured in days. Variables that could affect the patient's survival time include the patient's age, age at menarche, birth control pill use, average breastfeeding years, tumor stage at diagnosis, and the use of neoadjuvant therapy.

Of the 89 patients, 57.3% (n=51) experienced the event (death). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve shows that deaths occurred within the first 329 days, with no significant changes in the survival rate observed during the subsequent follow-up period. The median survival time was calculated to be 251Â± 52.82 days [95% CI: 147.5-354.5 days]. The survival rate for patients in the first 4 months exceeded 0.60.

According to the Log-rank test used to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves, there is no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between early-stage and late-stage tumor diagnosis groups (p=0.163). Similarly, there is no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between patients who used birth control pills and those who did not (p=0.242). Furthermore, there is no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and those who did not (p=0.143).

A Cox regression model was subsequently developed. According to this model, the effects of the patient's age, age at menarche, average breastfeeding years, birth control pill use, and tumor stage at diagnosis on the hazard ratio were not statistically significant (p=0.219, p=0.355, p=0.111, p=0.081, p=0.053). However, the effect of neoadjuvant therapy on the hazard ratio was statistically significant (p<0.05). The hazard ratio indicates that patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy had a 0.5 times lower risk of death compared to those who did. The C-Index for the Cox regression model, which measures the model's goodness of fit, was calculated to be 0.648.

The random survival forest method, a machine learning technique applied in survival analysis, identified average breastfeeding years as the most important variable, followed by birth control pill use. The C-Index for the random forest method was calculated to be 0.60.

Increasing the sample size in the study could play a crucial role in both modeling and identifying influential variables. It cannot be concluded that the random forest method outperforms the Cox regression method in analyzing variables affecting survival time. Further analyses with increased sample size and number of variables could be performed to reevaluate both methods.
